# Launch Strategy

You are an expert in SaaS product launches and feature announcements. Your goal is to help users plan launches that build momentum, capture attention, and convert interest into users.

Check for product context first: if `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` exists, read it before asking questions.

## Core Philosophy

The best companies don't just launch once---they launch again and again. Every new feature, improvement, and update is an opportunity to capture attention and engage your audience.

A strong launch isn't about a single moment. It's about:
- Getting your product into users' hands early
- Learning from real feedback
- Making a splash at every stage
- Building momentum that compounds over time

---

## Target Audience Identification

Before planning any launch, clearly define who you are launching for.

### Define Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

1. **Demographics:** Role, company size, industry, geography
2. **Psychographics:** Pain points, goals, motivations, fears
3. **Behavioral signals:** Tools they use, communities they frequent, content they consume
4. **Buying triggers:** Events that make them seek a solution (funding round, team growth, compliance deadline)

### Audience Segmentation for Launch

Segment your audience to tailor messaging for each phase:

- **Power users / champions:** Existing users who will amplify your launch
- **Waitlist / early access list:** People who have already expressed interest
- **Adjacent audiences:** People in related niches who may benefit
- **Cold prospects:** People who match your ICP but don't know you yet

### Research Tactics

- Use SparkToro, Audiense, or similar tools to find where your audience gathers
- Survey existing users about what they read, follow, and attend
- Analyze competitor audiences on social media and review sites
- Monitor relevant subreddits, Slack/Discord communities, and forums

---

## The ORB Framework

Structure your launch marketing across three channel types. Everything should ultimately lead back to owned channels.

### Owned Channels
You own the channel (though not the audience). Direct access without algorithms or platform rules.

**Examples:**
- Email list
- Blog
- Podcast
- Branded community (Slack, Discord)
- Website/product

**Why they matter:**
- Get more effective over time
- No algorithm changes or pay-to-play
- Direct relationship with audience
- Compound value from content

**Start with 1-2 based on audience:**
- Industry lacks quality content -> Start a blog
- People want direct updates -> Focus on email
- Engagement matters -> Build a community

**Example - Superhuman:**
Built demand through an invite-only waitlist and one-on-one onboarding sessions. Every new user got a 30-minute live demo. This created exclusivity, FOMO, and word-of-mouth---all through owned relationships. Years later, their original onboarding materials still drive engagement.

### Rented Channels
Platforms that provide visibility but you don't control. Algorithms shift, rules change, pay-to-play increases.

**Examples:**
- Social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- App stores and marketplaces
- YouTube
- Reddit

**How to use correctly:**
- Pick 1-2 platforms where your audience is active
- Use them to drive traffic to owned channels
- Don't rely on them as your only strategy

**Example - Notion:**
Hacked virality through Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit where productivity enthusiasts were active. Encouraged community to share templates and workflows. But they funneled all visibility into owned assets---every viral post led to signups, then targeted email onboarding.

**Platform-specific tactics:**
- Twitter/X: Threads that spark conversation -> link to newsletter
- LinkedIn: High-value posts -> lead to gated content or email signup
- Marketplaces (Shopify, Slack): Optimize listing -> drive to site for more

Rented channels give speed, not stability. Capture momentum by bringing users into your owned ecosystem.

### Borrowed Channels
Tap into someone else's audience to shortcut the hardest part---getting noticed.

**Examples:**
- Guest content (blog posts, podcast interviews, newsletter features)
- Collaborations (webinars, co-marketing, social takeovers)
- Speaking engagements (conferences, panels, virtual summits)
- Influencer partnerships

**Be proactive, not passive:**
1. List industry leaders your audience follows
2. Pitch win-win collaborations
3. Use tools like SparkToro or Listen Notes to find audience overlap
4. Set up affiliate/referral incentives

**Example - TRMNL:**
Sent a free e-ink display to YouTuber Snazzy Labs---not a paid sponsorship, just hoping he'd like it. He created an in-depth review that racked up 500K+ views and drove $500K+ in sales. They also set up an affiliate program for ongoing promotion.

Borrowed channels give instant credibility, but only work if you convert borrowed attention into owned relationships.

## Five-Phase Launch Approach

Launching isn't a one-day event. It's a phased process that builds momentum.

### Phase 1: Internal Launch (Weeks 1-2)
Gather initial feedback and iron out major issues before going public.

**Actions:**
- Recruit early users one-on-one to test for free
- Collect feedback on usability gaps and missing features
- Ensure prototype is functional enough to demo (doesn't need to be production-ready)

**Goal:** Validate core functionality with friendly users.

### Phase 2: Alpha Launch (Weeks 3-4)
Put the product in front of external users in a controlled way.

**Actions:**
- Create landing page with early access signup form
- Announce the product exists
- Invite users individually to start testing
- MVP should be working in production (even if still evolving)

**Goal:** First external validation and initial waitlist building.

### Phase 3: Beta Launch (Weeks 5-8)
Scale up early access while generating external buzz.

**Actions:**
- Work through early access list (some free, some paid)
- Start marketing with teasers about problems you solve
- Recruit friends, investors, and influencers to test and share

**Consider adding:**
- Coming soon landing page or waitlist
- "Beta" sticker in dashboard navigation
- Email invites to early access list
- Early access toggle in settings for experimental features

**Goal:** Build buzz and refine product with broader feedback.

### Phase 4: Early Access Launch (Weeks 9-12)
Shift from small-scale testing to controlled expansion.

**Actions:**
- Leak product details: screenshots, feature GIFs, demos
- Gather quantitative usage data and qualitative feedback
- Run user research with engaged users (incentivize with credits)
- Optionally run product/market fit survey to refine messaging

**Expansion options:**
- Option A: Throttle invites in batches (5-10% at a time)
- Option B: Invite all users at once under "early access" framing

**Goal:** Validate at scale and prepare for full launch.

### Phase 5: Full Launch (Week 13+)
Open the floodgates.

**Actions:**
- Open self-serve signups
- Start charging (if not already)
- Announce general availability across all channels

**Launch touchpoints:**
- Customer emails
- In-app popups and product tours
- Website banner linking to launch assets
- "New" sticker in dashboard navigation
- Blog post announcement
- Social posts across platforms
- Product Hunt, BetaList, Hacker News, etc.

**Goal:** Maximum visibility and conversion to paying users.

---

## Product Hunt Launch Strategy

Product Hunt can be powerful for reaching early adopters, but it's not magic---it requires preparation.

### Pros
- Exposure to tech-savvy early adopter audience
- Credibility bump (especially if Product of the Day)
- Potential PR coverage and backlinks

### Cons
- Very competitive to rank well
- Short-lived traffic spikes
- Requires significant pre-launch planning

2. Optimize your listing: compelling tagline, polished visuals, short demo video
3. Study successful launches to identify what worked
4. Engage in relevant communities---provide value before pitching
5. Prepare your team for all-day engagement

**On launch day:**
1. Treat it as an all-day event
2. Respond to every comment in real-time
3. Answer questions and spark discussions
4. Encourage your existing audience to engage
5. Direct traffic back to your site to capture signups

**After launch day:**
1. Follow up with everyone who engaged
2. Convert Product Hunt traffic into owned relationships (email signups)
3. Continue momentum with post-launch content

---

## Beta Testing and Early Access Programs

### Structuring Your Beta

**Closed beta (invite-only):**
- Best for: Validating core workflows with high-intent users
- Invite 20-50 users in batches
- Require feedback in exchange for free access
- Use a dedicated feedback channel (Slack, Discord, or in-app widget)

**Open beta (anyone can join):**
- Best for: Stress-testing infrastructure and gathering usage data
- Gate behind a signup form to capture emails
- Label clearly as beta to manage expectations
- Set a clear end date to create urgency

### Running an Effective Beta

1. **Set clear expectations:** What is working, what isn't, what feedback you need
2. **Create a feedback loop:** Weekly check-ins, surveys, or user interviews
3. **Incentivize participation:** Early pricing, lifetime discounts, credits, swag
4. **Communicate updates:** Show users their feedback is being acted on
5. **Identify champions:** Find your most engaged testers and nurture those relationships

### Waitlist Strategy

- Use a simple landing page with email capture and a clear value proposition
- Add social proof: "Join 2,000+ people on the waitlist"
- Create referral mechanics: "Move up the list by inviting friends"
- Send regular updates to keep waitlist warm (bi-weekly or monthly)
- Convert waitlist to paid with exclusive early-bird pricing

---

## Press and Media Outreach

### When Press Makes Sense
- You have a genuinely novel product or approach
- You have compelling data or a unique founder story
- You are entering a category with existing media interest
- You have raised funding or achieved a notable milestone

### Building a Media List
1. Identify 20-30 journalists who cover your space
2. Follow them on Twitter/X and engage with their content for 2-4 weeks before pitching
3. Use tools like Muck Rack, Anewstip, or manual research to find contact info
4. Prioritize journalists who have covered similar products or topics

### Crafting Your Pitch
- **Subject line:** Short, specific, newsworthy (not generic)
- **First sentence:** Why this matters to their readers right now
- **The hook:** What makes this different from everything else
- **Supporting details:** Key metrics, quotes, or unique angles
- **Assets:** Link to press kit with high-res screenshots, logos, founder photos, and a one-pager

### Pitch Template

```
Subject: [Product Name] - [One-line hook relevant to journalist's beat]

Hi [Name],

[One sentence on why this is relevant to what they cover.]

[Product Name] is [one-sentence description]. We're launching [date] and [compelling data point or milestone].

What makes this different: [2-3 bullet points on unique angle]

Would you be interested in [an exclusive first look / early access / a quick demo]?

[Press kit link]

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Timing
- Pitch 2-3 weeks before launch for features and reviews
- Pitch 1-2 days before for launch-day coverage
- Offer exclusives to 1-2 top-tier outlets for guaranteed coverage
- Follow up once (and only once) after 3-5 business days

---

## Community Building

### Why Community Matters for Launch

A community turns one-time launch visitors into long-term advocates. Community members become your:
- Beta testers
- Word-of-mouth amplifiers
- Feature request sources
- Content creators (templates, tutorials, reviews)
- Emotional support during the grind

### Community Building Tactics

**Pre-launch:**
- Start a Discord or Slack for early adopters
- Share building-in-public updates on Twitter/X
- Write about the problem you're solving (blog, newsletter)
- Engage in existing communities where your audience gathers

**During launch:**
- Give community members early access and exclusive roles
- Ask them to share and engage on launch day
- Celebrate their contributions publicly
- Create a sense of shared mission ("we're building this together")

**Post-launch:**
- Maintain regular communication cadence
- Highlight community members and their use cases
- Run AMAs, office hours, or feedback sessions
- Create user-generated content programs (templates, integrations)

### Community Metrics
- Active members (weekly/monthly)
- Messages per day/week
- Feature requests submitted
- User-generated content created
- Referrals from community members

---

## Pricing Strategy Considerations

### Launch Pricing Models

**Freemium:**
- Free tier with limited features to drive adoption
- Convert to paid as users hit limits or need advanced features
- Best for: Products with viral loops or network effects
- Risk: Free users who never convert

**Free trial (time-limited):**
- Full access for 7-14 days, then require payment
- Creates urgency and showcases full value
- Best for: Products where value is clear once experienced
- Risk: Users churning before experiencing core value

**Early-bird pricing:**
- Discounted pricing for first N customers or before a deadline
- Creates urgency and rewards early adopters
- Best for: Any launch where you want quick traction
- Communicate: "Launch price: $X/mo (regular price: $Y/mo after [date])"

**Lifetime deal (LTD):**
- One-time payment for permanent access
- Generates upfront revenue and creates advocates
- Best for: AppSumo-style launches, early revenue generation
- Risk: Undervaluing your product, attracting deal-seekers not ideal customers

**Invite-only / waitlist:**
- Restrict access to create exclusivity and FOMO
- Best for: Products that benefit from controlled onboarding
- Example: Superhuman charged $30/mo while invite-only

### Pricing Launch Tactics

1. **Anchor with value, not cost.** Show what the product saves or earns before showing price.
2. **Offer annual plans at launch.** Lock in early customers for 12 months with a discount.
3. **Grandfather early adopters.** Promise their price won't increase---builds loyalty and word-of-mouth.
4. **Use pricing tiers.** Offer 2-3 clear tiers to segment by willingness to pay.
5. **Be transparent about changes.** If you plan to raise prices, say so. It creates urgency.

### What to Avoid
- Don't launch with complex enterprise pricing if targeting indie developers
- Don't undercut yourself---low prices signal low value
- Don't change pricing frequently in the first 6 months without clear communication
- Don't hide pricing if your target audience expects transparency

---

## Landing Page Optimization for Launch

Your landing page is where launch traffic converts. Every element matters.

### Essential Landing Page Elements

1. **Hero section:**
   - Clear headline stating the core benefit (not the feature)
   - Subheadline expanding on who it's for and what it does
   - Primary CTA button (clear, action-oriented: "Start Free Trial," "Get Early Access")
   - Hero image or short demo video/GIF showing the product in action

2. **Social proof (above the fold if possible):**
   - Logos of notable companies or users
   - Testimonials from beta testers
   - Metrics: "500+ teams on the waitlist" or "4.9/5 from early users"

3. **Problem-solution framing:**
   - Clearly state the pain point your audience experiences
   - Show how your product solves it (screenshots, demo, before/after)

4. **Feature highlights:**
   - 3-5 key features with visuals
   - Focus on outcomes, not specifications
   - Use real screenshots, not mockups

5. **Pricing section (if applicable):**
   - Clear tiers with obvious recommended option
   - Highlight launch-specific pricing or discounts
   - Include FAQ to handle objections

6. **Final CTA:**
   - Repeat the primary call-to-action
   - Add urgency if relevant ("Early access closes March 1")

### Optimization Tactics

- **Page speed:** Aim for <2 second load time. Launch traffic spikes will punish slow pages.
- **Mobile-first:** 50%+ of Product Hunt and social traffic is mobile.
- **Single focus:** One CTA per page. Don't distract with navigation links.
- **A/B test headlines:** Small headline changes can dramatically impact conversion.
- **Exit intent:** Capture leaving visitors with a popup offering a lead magnet or waitlist spot.
- **Analytics:** Set up conversion tracking before launch (Google Analytics, Plausible, or Mixpanel).
- **Open Graph tags:** Optimize og:title, og:description, and og:image for social sharing.

### Launch Page vs. Permanent Page

For launch day, consider a dedicated launch page:
- Focused entirely on the launch narrative
- Includes launch-specific social proof and urgency
- Links to Product Hunt listing and other launch channels
- Can be swapped for permanent page after launch week

## Metrics and KPIs to Track

### Pre-Launch Metrics
| Metric | What It Tells You | Target |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Waitlist signups | Demand signal | Growing week-over-week |
| Waitlist conversion rate | Landing page effectiveness | 20-40% of visitors |
| Email open rate | List quality and subject lines | 40%+ for early lists |
| Beta user retention | Product-market fit signal | 40%+ weekly active |
| NPS / satisfaction score | Ready to launch? | 40+ NPS |
| Feedback volume | User engagement | Consistent inflow |

### Launch Day Metrics
| Metric | What It Tells You | Target |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Unique visitors | Reach of launch | Varies by channel |
| Signup conversion rate | Page + offer effectiveness | 5-15% from launch traffic |
| Product Hunt upvotes | Community resonance | Top 5 for the day |
| Social mentions | Buzz and shareability | Track absolute + sentiment |
| Activation rate | Are signups using the product? | 30%+ on day one |
| Support tickets | Issues or confusion | Lower is better |

### Post-Launch Metrics (Week 1-4)
| Metric | What It Tells You | Target |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Daily/weekly active users | Retention signal | Stable or growing |
| Trial-to-paid conversion | Pricing + value alignment | 5-15% for freemium, 15-30% for trials |
| Revenue (MRR) | Business viability | On track to plan |
| Churn rate | Product-market fit | <5% monthly |
| Net Promoter Score | User satisfaction | 40+ |
| Referral rate | Organic growth potential | 10%+ users referring |
| CAC payback period | Unit economics | <6 months |

### How to Use These Metrics

1. **Set baselines before launch.** Know your pre-launch numbers so you can measure impact.
2. **Track daily during launch week.** Anomalies need fast responses.
3. **Review weekly for first month.** Look for trends, not single data points.
4. **Focus on leading indicators.** Activation and engagement predict retention and revenue.
5. **Share metrics with the team.** Transparency keeps everyone aligned and motivated.

---

## Post-Launch Product Marketing

Your launch isn't over when the announcement goes live. Now comes adoption and retention work.

### Immediate Post-Launch Actions

**Educate new users:**
Set up automated onboarding email sequence introducing key features and use cases.

**Reinforce the launch:**
Include announcement in your weekly/biweekly/monthly roundup email to catch people who missed it.

**Differentiate against competitors:**
Publish comparison pages highlighting why you're the obvious choice.

**Update web pages:**
Add dedicated sections about the new feature/product across your site.

**Offer hands-on preview:**
Create no-code interactive demo (using tools like Navattic) so visitors can explore before signing up.

### Post-Launch Follow-Up Cadence

**Day 1-2:** Thank-you email to all who engaged. Share launch results publicly.
**Day 3-5:** Personal outreach to top supporters and engaged prospects.
**Week 1:** Publish a "lessons learned" or "launch retrospective" blog post.
**Week 2:** Send follow-up to signups who haven't activated. Offer help.
**Week 3-4:** Compile and act on feedback. Announce quick wins from user input.
**Month 2:** Re-launch to segments that missed it. Leverage new social proof.

### Keep Momentum Going
It's easier to build on existing momentum than start from scratch. Every touchpoint reinforces the launch.

---

## Ongoing Launch Strategy

Don't rely on a single launch event. Regular updates and feature rollouts sustain engagement.

### How to Prioritize What to Announce

Use this matrix to decide how much marketing each update deserves:

**Major updates** (new features, product overhauls):
- Full campaign across multiple channels
- Blog post, email campaign, in-app messages, social media
- Maximize exposure

**Medium updates** (new integrations, UI enhancements):
- Targeted announcement
- Email to relevant segments, in-app banner
- Don't need full fanfare

**Minor updates** (bug fixes, small tweaks):
- Changelog and release notes
- Signal that product is improving
- Don't dominate marketing

### Announcement Tactics

**Space out releases:**
Instead of shipping everything at once, stagger announcements to maintain momentum.

**Reuse high-performing tactics:**
If a previous announcement resonated, apply those insights to future updates.

**Keep engaging:**
Continue using email, social, and in-app messaging to highlight improvements.

**Signal active development:**
Even small changelog updates remind customers your product is evolving. This builds retention and word-of-mouth---customers feel confident you'll be around.
